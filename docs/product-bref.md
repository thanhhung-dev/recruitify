Project Brief: Recruitify

Executive Summary
Recruitify is a web-based job search platform designed to simplify and centralize the job search and application process. It addresses the dual problem of a fragmented experience for job seekers and an inefficient management process for employers. By providing a unified platform for posting jobs, searching for relevant opportunities, and tracking applications, Recruitify aims to become the go-to destination for students, professionals, and HR teams seeking a more effective hiring and job-seeking experience.

Problem Statement
The current job search landscape is inefficient for both sides of the market.

For Job Seekers: The process is fragmented across numerous websites, making it difficult to find relevant opportunities and track the status of multiple applications. This leads to wasted time, missed opportunities, and a frustrating user experience.

For Employers/HR Teams: Many existing platforms are either too complex, too expensive, or fail to attract a quality pool of candidates. This results in a time-consuming process for posting roles, managing incoming applications, and maintaining a clear view of the candidate pipeline.

Proposed Solution
Recruitify provides a streamlined, all-in-one web platform that connects job seekers with employers. The core of the solution is a clean, intuitive interface that removes friction from the hiring process.

For seekers, it offers a central hub to search, save, and apply for jobs with a consistent, user-friendly workflow.

For employers, it provides a simple, powerful dashboard to post job listings, manage the company's active roles, and review incoming applicants efficiently.

Target Users
Primary User Segment: Job Seekers

Profile: Students, recent graduates, and seasoned professionals actively or passively looking for new career opportunities.

Needs: A simple, powerful search function; the ability to save jobs of interest; a straightforward application process; and a way to track their application history and status.

Secondary User Segment: Employers/HR Teams

Profile: Small to medium-sized businesses and corporate HR teams.

Needs: An easy-to-use interface for posting and managing job listings; an efficient way to view and filter candidates; and access to a quality pool of applicants.

MVP Success Criteria

Post-MVP Vision
Phase 2 Features: Introduce direct messaging, advanced company profiles, and premium job posting options.

Long-term Vision: Become a comprehensive career platform with AI-driven job matching, skill assessments, and integration with professional networking features.

Expansion Opportunities: Potentially expand into freelance/gig marketplaces or specialized industry verticals.

Technical Considerations
Platform Requirements: The application must be a responsive web app, providing a seamless experience on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.

Technology Preferences

Frontend: Next.js with Ant Design

Backend: Spring Boot (RESTful API)

Database: PostgreSQL

Architecture Considerations

Repository Structure: A monorepo to manage both frontend and backend code is recommended for streamlined development.

Service Architecture: A monolithic service architecture is suitable for the MVP, with the potential to break out microservices later.

Integration Requirements: No major external integrations are required for the MVP.

Constraints & Assumptions
Constraints

Timeline: Target an MVP launch within 3-4 months.

Budget: To be determined. This will influence post-MVP scope.

Resources: Assumes a small, agile full-stack development team.

Key Assumptions

There is a sufficient market need for a new, simplified job platform to compete with incumbents.

Job seekers are willing to create profiles on a new platform.

The simplicity of the employer dashboard will be a key driver for adoption.

Risks & Open Questions
Key Risks

Market Adoption (Chicken-and-egg problem): The platform is only valuable with a critical mass of both job listings and active seekers. A key risk is failing to attract one side without the other already present.

Competition: The job board market is highly saturated with large, established players.

Data Security: Protecting sensitive personal information (resumes, contact info) and company data is critical.

Open Questions

What is the initial go-to-market strategy to attract the first 100 employers and 1,000 job seekers?

What will be the key differentiator to stand out against competitors like LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.?

What is the long-term monetization strategy?

PM Handoff

This Project Brief provides the full context for the Recruitify platform. The next step is to engage the Product Manager (PM) to create a detailed PRD. The PM will use this brief to define specific epics and user stories, and to flesh out functional and non-functional requirements.
