# Project Brief: Recruitify

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the project brief for "Recruitify," a modern job search platform designed to connect talented professionals with recruiting organizations. The primary problem this project addresses is the often inefficient and frustrating experience for both job seekers and recruiters on existing platforms. Our target market is initially focused on the technology sector. The key value proposition is a streamlined, user-friendly, and fast interface that simplifies the process of finding and applying for jobs, and for recruiters to manage postings.

## Problem Statement

For job seekers, the current landscape of job boards is often cluttered, with slow interfaces and cumbersome application processes. It can be difficult to track application statuses and receive timely feedback. For recruiters, posting jobs and managing candidates can be equally inefficient, making it challenging to find qualified candidates quickly. Existing solutions often lack a modern technology stack, leading to a subpar user experience.

## Proposed Solution

We propose to build a modern web application, "Recruitify," with a focus on speed, simplicity, and user experience. The solution will consist of a Next.js frontend using Ant Design for a clean and responsive UI, and a robust backend powered by Spring Boot and a PostgreSQL database. The core concept is to provide a highly focused set of features for the MVP that perfects the core experience of job searching, applying, and management, with a plan for intelligent features post-MVP.

## Target Users

### Primary User Segment: Job Seekers
- **Profile:** Technology professionals (software engineers, designers, product managers, etc.) who are actively or passively looking for new opportunities.
- **Needs:** A fast, efficient way to find relevant jobs, apply easily, and track their application status. They value a clean UI and a non-intrusive experience.

### Secondary User Segment: Recruiters
- **Profile:** In-house recruiters and hiring managers at technology companies.
- **Needs:** An easy-to-use platform to post job openings, manage candidate applications, and find qualified talent.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives
- Successfully launch the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) within a 3-4 month timeframe.
- Achieve a stable and functional platform that supports the core user journeys.

### User Success Metrics
- High satisfaction scores from both job seekers and recruiters.
- A low average time for a user to complete a job application.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** Measure of user engagement.
- **Number of Job Applications Submitted:** Core metric for platform utility.
- **Number of Jobs Posted:** Core metric for the recruiter side of the platform.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)
- **User Authentication:** Secure login/registration for both user types, including social sign-on with Google/LinkedIn.
- **Full CRUD for Jobs:** Recruiters can create, read, update, and delete job postings.
- **Full CRUD for User Profiles:** Job seekers can create and manage their professional profiles.
- **Job Search:** A clean search interface with basic filters (e.g., title, location).
- **Apply to Job:** A streamlined, single-action application process using the user's stored profile data.
- **Job Seeker Dashboard:** Allows users to view their application history and saved/favorited jobs.
- **Employer Dashboard:** Allows recruiters to manage their job postings and view applicants.
- **Email Notifications:** Automated emails for key events, such as application status changes.

### Out of Scope for MVP
- Advanced AI-powered features (recommendations, recruiter assistant).
- In-app messaging or chat.
- Company profile deep-dives or reviews.
- Skills assessments or testing.
- Monetization features.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Phase 2 Features
- **Smart and personalized search:** Evolve the basic search to include AI-powered recommendations based on user history and profile.
- **AI assistant for recruiters:** A tool to provide advice on job postings to improve their visibility and attract more qualified applicants.

### Long-term Vision
- To become a leading job search platform in the technology sector, known for its exceptional user experience and intelligent features that actively help both job seekers and recruiters succeed.

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements
- **Target Platforms:** Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Performance Requirements:** Fast page loads and a responsive, non-blocking user interface.

### Technology Preferences
- **Frontend:** Next.js with Ant Design.
- **UI/UX Design:** Figma.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL.
- **Hosting/Infrastructure:** To be determined (e.g., Vercel for frontend, AWS/GCP for backend).

### Architecture Considerations
- **Repository Structure:** To be determined (Monorepo or separate frontend/backend repositories).
- **Service Architecture:** REST API for communication between frontend and backend.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Timeline:** A firm 3-4 month deadline for the MVP launch.
- **Resources:** Development will be based on the specified technology stack.

### Key Assumptions
- The chosen technology stack is appropriate for the project goals.
- The team possesses the necessary expertise in Next.js, Spring Boot, and the other specified technologies.
- A 3-4 month timeline is realistic for the defined MVP scope.

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **Scope Creep:** The temptation to add more features to the MVP could risk the 3-4 month timeline. Mitigation: Strict adherence to the defined MVP scope.
- **Competition:** The job search market is crowded. Mitigation: Focus on superior user experience and a niche (tech sector) to gain an initial foothold.

### Open Questions
- What is the long-term monetization strategy?
- How will the platform be marketed to attract an initial user base of job seekers and recruiters?
